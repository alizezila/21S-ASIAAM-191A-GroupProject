        <p> Attempting to cross the southern border of the United States, migrants and refugees face a road full of violence and treachery. With the ongoing threats of climate change, political instability, and economic uncertainty triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, incidences of abduction, torture, extreme violence, cruel treatment, and sexual assault continue to increase. Thus, <i>Justicia Migratoria</i> seeks to develop a tool for community members to <strong>(1) </strong> <span style="color:darkviolet ">document incidents of violence experienced in the migration trail</span>, <strong>(2) </strong> <span style="color: Tomato">uplift migrantsâ€™ stories on their own terms</span>, and <strong>(3) </strong> <span style="color:darkgreen">bring visibility to the resources needed by migrants in order to mobilize civil society towards appropriate actions</span>.</p> 
        <p>If you are a migrant and survivor of any form of violence at the United States border, and interested in bringing visibility to the human rights violations faced by those en route to the United States, we invite you to report your assault through our online survey. Legal advocates are also welcome to take our survey to report on behalf of migrant survivors, as well as to share their own experiences, struggles, and barriers to their work. All survey responses remain anonymous. </p>
