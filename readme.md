# Group Project Description

Although our group is still working to come up with the focus of our project, the social problem our group seeks to address is **anti-imperialism**. Two ideas that are exploring are (a) dive into vaccine distributions locally or (b) look at the disproportionate burden of climate change on communities of color. The decision on which route to follow will be based on our ability to connect with a local organization that can benefit from this type of project, but our internal deadline to make a decision is this weekend.

**Potential challenges for this projecr:**
* Initially, getting up to speed with the technical skills required to execute this project - it will be a steep learning curve for all of us!
* If we follow the route of vaccine distribution, there could be some privacy considerations given the sensitive nature of healthcare information.

*More details to come by the end of the weekend, stay tuned!*
